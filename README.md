# Apex Vault

## Project Title
**Apex Vault** – The Ultimate Secure & Upgradable Yield Vault

## Project Description
Apex Vault is a next-generation, proxy-upgradable smart contract vault that allows users to securely deposit ETH and any ERC20 token. Built with OpenZeppelin's battle-tested upgradeable contracts, it features reentrancy protection, role-based access control, pausing mechanism, and emergency withdrawal capabilities.

Designed for institutional-grade security while remaining flexible for future yield strategies.

## Project Vision
To become the most trusted and widely adopted on-chain vault infrastructure, enabling seamless integration of advanced DeFi strategies (lending, liquidity providing, options, etc.) while maintaining maximum capital safety and upgradability.

## Key Features
- **Native ETH + ERC20 Support** – Deposit and withdraw any token or ETH in one contract
- **Upgradeable (UUPS)** – Future-proof design with OpenZeppelin Upgrades
- **Pausable** – Emergency stop mechanism by admin
- **ReentrancyGuard** – Protection against reentrancy attacks
- **Role-Based Access Control** – Separate `ADMIN` and `STRATEGIST` roles
- **Emergency Withdraw** – Admin can rescue funds when paused
- **Total Assets Tracking** – Transparent accounting of AUM
- **Event Emission** – Full audit trail of deposits/withdrawals

## Future Scope
- Integrate with Yearn-style automated yield strategies
- Add share-based system (deposit receipts as ERC20 tokens)
- Support for multiple yield-bearing strategies (Aave, Compound, Curve, etc.)
- Harvest rewards and auto-compounding
- Governance module with APEX token
- Cross-chain deployment (Layer 2, Bitcoin via Stacks, etc.)
- Insurance module integration

Apex Vault is just the beginning.
